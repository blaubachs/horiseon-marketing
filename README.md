# Horiseon Marketing

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor code to be more accessible to any person who may visit the webpage for Horiseon Marketing. This was changed by removing "old" tags, and using semantic HTML elements so screen readers can more accurately read information to users. Throughout this, I learned more about CSS, and semantic HTML elements.
